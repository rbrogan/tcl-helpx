The documentation for Helpx consists of command reference pages similar to those
of the core Tcl commands.

Each command is well-documented with a reference page which includes:

* A short description for the command.
* Usage synopsis.
* Return value description.
* Argument descriptions.
* Table of error conditions, error code and message, and consequences of the
error occurrence.
* Examples.
* Related commands to see also.
* Links to the keyword index.
* Various additional notes.

To go through the documentation you can use:

* Compiled HTML Help. Open helpx.chm.
* Frames-based HTML. Open manual-home.html.
* No-frames HTML. Open noframes-start.html.
