Welcome to Helpx! We recommend you go through the following pages, in order, to learn about what Helpx is and how to use it. It should take you less than hour to get to where you can make a Helpx database and bundle it in your package so that your users can access command documentation.</p>
<p>Note that to use Helpx, you must also have <a href='http://www.robertbrogan.com'>Gen</a> installed, a general utility library which Helpx uses.
</p>
<p><a href='about-helpx.html'>About Helpx</a> - A quick intro to Helpx that tells you what it is and what it is not, what it can and cannot do.</p>
<p><a href='how-to-use-helpx.html'>How to Use Helpx</a> - A tutorial and reference that tells you how to do basic things with Helpx and get you to where you can bundle documentation in your Tcl packages.</p>
<p><a href='helpx-database-schema.html'>Helpx Database Schema</a> - Gives you a rundown of the database schema Helpx uses so that you can go beyond the base Helpx commands and do what you like with the database.</p>
